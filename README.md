Welcome to the Calculator Program v2.0. This was made to implement the things I learned in Java, in the future there will be a GUI version.

In order to run this open a terminal or command prompt and excecute

java -jar Calculator.jar 

in the bin folder.

If you want to compile it simply use an IDE of your choice and make a runnable jar, then follow the instructions above.
