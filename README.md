#Calculator
Welcome to the Calculator Program v2.0. This was made to implement the things I learned in Java, in the future there will be a real GUI version. 
Currently there is a basic GUI version you can use.

In order to run the command line based calculator open a terminal or command prompt and excecute

java -jar Calculator.jar 

in the bin folder.

If you want to run the GUI version just double click on CalculatorBasicGui.jar

If you want to compile it simply use an IDE of your choice click compile and make a runnable jar, then follow the instructions above.
